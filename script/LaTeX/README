This is the example of "pcap2tex" script usage.

The "pcap2tex" is the perl script for the Packet Flow Diagram generation.
It creates the LaTeX include files using the TikZ-picture package commands.

Please see the pdf-files in the Project/* subdirectories for the example
diagrams.

Input Files: 
	call.pcap	-  wireshark PCAP data file
	call.cfg	-  configuration file for the IP<->DeviceName mapping.

Output Files:
